## Task

Today's task is to create a represntation of the experience you have when trying to buy one way tickets through an airline.

There will be three parts of the task to perform:

1. Enter desired dates / airports and click 'Search'
2. Choose from among a list of available flights
3. Enter passenger information for all passengers
4. Enter billing information

----

Obviously billing informaiton is not needed or wanted in this particular situation. It would normally be done through a 3rd party API anyway.
